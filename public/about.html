<h2>Techincal Aspects:</h2>
<p>
  Hi! I am P V Damodaram. I am a 3rd year student of the Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai in the disipline of Electical 
  Engineering. Even though I studied Electrical engineering for the first 2 years of my college, I am now more intrested to 
  work up as a software developer in my future. So I took this course on web development by Angela Yu to take a new step into 
  the wonderful world of software development, and hone my skills.

  <h3>Some of the things that intrests me are:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Solving the problems in programming using logic - if you get it :(</li>
    <li>Exploring new stuff that i didn't her before to make some tasks easier.</li>
    <li>The feeing you get after working sooo long and hard for a problem - Yes it intrest me :)</li>
    <li>And so on....</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Non technical:</h2>
<p>
  I would best describe myself as a "Chill" kind of person outside techincal side until it come to you not agreeing with my favorite
  web series, anime or movies. JK :). Yes, I really like so the all these in my freetime to get a break form these mind blowing tech
  stuff. Again JK :).Apart from these I read books (Chetan Bhagath is the greatest author - Agree), play volleyball as a defender, do 
  online quizzes such as Wordle, Spellbee etc., and surf through social media as hobbies.
